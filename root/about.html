          <h1>MEGHAN LEACH</h1>
          <p>I serve as both the teacher and caregiver at
  Little Blue Spruce. Prior to this, I spent five years
  teaching first and third grade at Monument
  Academy. I also led a K–5 Homeschool
  Enrichment Program there and spent a year
  developing and coordinating curriculum for the
  birth-to-three-year-old nursery at Woodmen
  Valley Chapel. I hold a degree in Elementary
  Education.</p><p>After welcoming my son in 2023, I felt a strong
  desire to support other moms by providing
  high-quality childcare and early education—
  while also laying a strong academic and social
  foundation for my own child.</p>

          <h3>What I Believe About Children</h3>
          <p>I want to be a teacher who leads with love. My
  program is a place of outlandish fun and
  purposeful energy.
  Learning here is rooted in play. Students are
  active participants who take pride in their
  growth. Every child is seen, included, and
  encouraged to rise to challenges.
  I aim to nurture independent thinkers who
  aren’t afraid to ask questions, admit when they
  don’t know something, and take initiative to
  discover the answers. I want them to dance
  freely, laugh loudly, and embrace their quirks,
  celebrating who they are. Every child is a gift.</p>
