      <p>At Little Blue Spruce, we believe
        in the power of play! We know
        that children learn best when
        they’re actively engaged and
        excited, so we focus on creating
        that kind of environment every
        day.
      </p>
      <p>Your child will thrive in a warm,
        home-like setting where they are
        listened to, respected, and
        valued. We also emphasize
        teaching children to listen to,
        respect, and appreciate each
        other.

          <h1>CURRICULUM</h1>
          <p>We blend an accredited preschool curriculum with teacher-created materials.</p><p>After welcoming my son in 2023, I felt a strong
            desire to support other moms by providing
            high-quality childcare and early education—
            while also laying a strong academic and social
            foundation for my own child.</p>
            <p>We incorporate <strong>What Your Preschooler Needs to Know</strong> from
            the Core Knowledge Foundation,
            along with other Core Knowledge
            resources, to shape our lessons
            and concepts.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, we design unique
            activities based on different
            themes, making learning fun and
            fostering a sense of community
            as we grow and explore together!
